I first read *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg when I was in university. It was one of the first personal development/popular psychology books I have ever read. Since then, many of the concepts in this book have been in my mind whenever I try to build new habits.

### Summary

#### The Habits of Individuals

We depend on habits on a daily basis to live our lives. Habits allow us to perform a wide variety of complicated activities without requiring significant brain power. However, this can become detrimental when we lose control of our habits.

Fortunately, we are able to change our habits, and if we understand the process of how habits work, this becomes easier. Habits operate based on the habit loop:

> This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future

Preceding the habit loop is the craving, which makes you anticipate the reward, triggering the habit. Habits only emerge once a craving is in place - otherwise, it's just basic learning.

Habits never really disappear, even when you remove the craving, which is why it is hard to get rid of a habit. However, the habit loop is delicate - if we keep the cue and reward, but insert a new routine, then we can change a habit.

> This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine, and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop.

Finally, belief makes a big different in the formation of habits.

> The evidence is clear: If you want to change a habit, you must find an alternative routine, and your odds of success go up dramatically when you commit to changing as part of a group. Belief is essential, and it grows out of a communal experience, even if that community is only as large as two people.
