### Summary

#### The Inner Game

Every game is composed of two parts: an outer game, and an inner game. The outer game is the physical component, while the inner game is the mental component. The inner game is often neglected, but is very important.

#### Self 1 vs. Self 2

Self 1 is the part of you that tells you what to do. Self 2 is the part that does what you tell it to do. Self 1 often judges and criticizes self 2 - it does not trust self 2. Although self 2 is very competent, this causes self 2 to mess up. This causes a negative feedback loop that makes self 2 worse.

#### Letting Go of Judgements

Judgement is assigning a negative or positive value to something.

#### Don't Try Too Hard



#### Trust Yourself

#### Programming Yourself


#### Importance of Concentration


#### The Meaning of Winning
