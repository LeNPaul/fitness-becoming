### Summary

#### The Inner Game

> Letting go of judgments, the art of programming with images and "letting it happen" are three of the basic skills involved in the Inner Game.

Every game is composed of two parts: an outer game, and an inner game. The outer game is the physical component, while the inner game is the mental component. The inner game is often neglected, but is very important.

#### Self 1 vs. Self 2

Self 1 is the part of you that tells you what to do. Self 2 is the part that does what you tell it to do. Self 1 often judges and criticizes self 2 - it does not trust self 2. Although self 2 is very competent, this causes self 2 to mess up. This causes a feedback loop that makes self 2 worse.

#### Controlling Self 1

The relationship between self 1 and self 2 determines how effective someone is. The less self 1 interferes with self 2, the more effective someone is. The following are strategies for preventing self 1 from interfering with self 2.

##### Don't Try Too Hard

> Quieting the mind means less thinking, calculating, judging, worrying, fearing, hoping, trying, regretting, controlling, jittering or distracting.

When you try too hard, you are letting self 1 take over. This leads to overthinking, distraction, tightness, and overall ineffectiveness. Instead, you should "just do it", and let self 2 take over without interference from self 1. Harmoney is achieved when the mind is still, quiet and not actively thinking or trying too hard to do something.

##### Let Go of Judgements

> The first skill to learn is the art of letting go the human inclination to judge ourselves and our performance as either good or bad. Letting go of the judging process is a basic key to the Inner Game;

Judgement is assigning a negative or positive value to something. If you judge something as negative, you will inevitably try too hard to improve. If you judge something as positive, you will try too hard to live up to expectations. Judgement causes interference with self 2. Getting rid of judgement allows you to see things as they are and improve (this is not the same as ignoring errors).

##### Let it Happen

Focus on seeings things as they are without judgement and labelling. Removing your ego from the situation. Learn to develop trust between self 1 and self 2, and letting things be as they are. This is analogous with a child learning how to walk with their parents - there is no judgement or criticism or identification of what should happen with any falls, just letting it be as the child learns.

#### Programming Yourself

The learning process involves self 1 communicating what it wants from self 2, and then letting self 2 do it. Self 2 acts based on stored memory from past actions and observations of others' actions. More practice results in deeper memory.

Images work better than words, and showing is better than telling. Involve as many senses as possible. Too much instruction is worse than none, and conscious trying often produces negative results.

The following are techniques for programming yourself:

1. **Programming for results:** self 1 sets goals for self 2, and then lets it perform without interference.

2. **Programming for form:** self 2 a clear image of what you want to do and go through the motions, imagining your form as you do it.

3. **Programming by identity:** play the role of what you want to be, and have self-confidence without any self-doubt.

#### Importance of Concentration

> The greatest lapses in concentration come when we allow our minds to project what is about to happen or to dwell on what has already happened. How easily the mind absorbs itself in the world of "what if's"

Concentration is focusing one's attention, which stills the mind and keeps it in the present. This is a skill that you learn that requires practice. The practice of meditation helps with concentration and remaining calm, which are both important tools. This allows you to see the true nature of what is happening and respond appropriately.

#### The Meaning of Winning

> Winning is overcoming obstacles to reach a goal, but the value in winning is only as great as the value of the goal reached. Reaching the goal itself may not be as valuable as the experience that can come in making a supreme effort to overcome the obstacles involved. The process can be more rewarding than the victory itself.

A game is an interaction between people involving an ulterior motive - a trial of strength or wits played within a system defined by rules. Most people's motives are to be good and achieve excellence. However, this leads to judgement, especially when people begin to question their worth based on how they compare to others.

Competitiveness (i.e. proving oneself) is often based on insecurity and self-doubt. This can cause the worst in a person to come out, and interence from self 1. Instead, winning should be about realizing the true limits of your capabilities using courage and concentration to overcome obstacles and explore latent capabilities. This results in self knowledge.

In this way, true competition is identical to true co-operation, where both sides challenge each other with obstacles to achieve their fully potential, and no one is actually defeated. You hope for a challenge that allows you to work on your weaknesses. Being defeated or defeating someone is good.

> The fool is a fool because he doesn't know how to learn from his experience; the wise man is wise because he does. Therefore the wise man will learn more from the conversation than the fool.
