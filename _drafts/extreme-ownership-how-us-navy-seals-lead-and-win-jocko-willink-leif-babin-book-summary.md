*Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win* by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin was a book that I had been meaning to read for a long time, ever since I first discovered Jocko Willink through [his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnKcquMobHQ). Although I was initially uninterested on the topics of war and military, the conversation on leadership and extreme ownership really resonated with me, and has since then had a big influence on my life and how I try to model myself as a leader.
