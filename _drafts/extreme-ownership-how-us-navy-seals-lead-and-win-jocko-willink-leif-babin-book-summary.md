*Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win* by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin was a book that I had been meaning to read for a long time, ever since I first discovered Jocko Willink through [his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnKcquMobHQ). Although I was initially uninterested on the topics of war and military, the conversation on leadership and extreme ownership really resonated with me, and has since had a big influence on my life with regard to leadership.

### Summary

When it comes to achieving a mission of any kind, leadership is the single most important factor for success. The following are principles for achieving optimal leadership.

#### Winning the War Within

##### Extreme Ownership

Leaders must own everything in their world, even if it is not in their direct control. They must accept responsibility for everything. They must admit mistakes and accept failures when they occur, without making excuses or blaming others.

##### No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders

> It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate.

The performance of a team is the responsibility of the leader - this is closely related to extreme ownership. Leaders are responsible for enforcing standards, and getting the team to work together, where everyone is utilizing their strengths to cover each other's weaknesses. Leaders should always strive for constant improvement. Ideally, once a culture of extreme ownership is cultivated, teams would be able continue to improve even if the leader is removed.

##### Believe

A leader must truly believe in the missionthat they are accomplishing, and understand the bigger picture of why something is being done. This requires detaching from the immediate tactical mission, and understanding how it fits into the larger strategic picture. Goals must always be in alignment. It is the leader's responsibility to understand the "why" and convey this to their team. If they themselves do not understand the "why", then it is their responsibility to seek clarity from senior leadership.

##### Check the Ego

Most problems in teams come from ego. Ego clouds and disrupts everything, from the planning process, to the ability to listen and accept constructive criticism. Often, the most difficult ego to deal with is your own. In some cases, having some ego is good, such as when it drives people to achieve. But when ego clouds our judgement, prevents us from seeing the world as it is or honestly assessing ourselves and others, it is bad. Personal agendas should never influence actions. Exercise extreme ownership and be humble - confident but not cocky - while never being complacent.

#### The Laws of Combat

##### Cover and Move

This principle highlights teamwork and clear communication. All elements in an operation must work together and mutually support each other. Any kind of silos or division should be broken down, and everyone should work together, avoiding competition with each other, developing animosity, or blaming each other when problems occur. Leaders need to maintain perspective and remind the team of the "why" of what they are doing. Main and supporting efforts should be clearly identified, and the focus should be on how best to accomplish the strategic mission.

##### Simple

The more complex the plans are, the less people will understand, and the more issues will be compounded when they occur. Simplify and communicate plans as much as possible so that the lowest denominator can understand, in order to ensure success. Everyone needs to understand their part and how to react when things go wrong. Everyone, including junior members, should be encouraged to ask questions if they don't understand anything.

##### Prioritize and Execute

> Relax, look around, make a call.

When issues occur, it is important to remain calm, avoid getting caught in the details, maintain the strategic picture, and prioritize, making the best decision possible while leading. Trying to multitask will overwhelm everyone and cause the team to fail. Plan for problems in advanced in order to stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems. This ensures that everyone is prepared and knows how to prioritize and execute when needed. This also frees up bandwidth, allowing for greater decisiveness. Priorities can rapidly change - avoid getting fixated on a single target and recognize when priorities change, communicating with the team as soon as possible.

Steps for prioritizing and executing:

1. Evaluate the highest priority problem for the team.

2. Develop a solution seeking diverse input.

3. Direct execution of the solution.

4. Move on to the next highest priority and repeat this process.

##### Decentralized Command

Leaders generally cannot manage more than 6 - 10 people at a time. Teams should ideally be broken down into 4 - 5 people with a clear leader who understands the why, or the the ultimate goal of the mission, also known as the Commander's Intent. Leaders must avoid micromanaging, while at the same time avoid not being too far removed from the situation. Leaders must be free to move to where they are most needed. Determining this balance is key for a leader.

Junior leaders need to be proactive instead of reactive - they say what they are going to do instead of asking. They should be empowered to make decisions on key tasks to accomplish the mission, and need to understand the scope of their authority. They should communicate with senior leaders when they need to make decisions outside of their scope, and pass on crucial information. Frontline leaders need to execute with confidence knowing that their leaders will support them, and that they understand the Commander's Intent. In general, everyone should be empowered to make their own decisions while communicating situational awareness across all levels of leadership.

#### Sustaining Victory

##### Plan

The planning process must be standardized so that everyone is on the same page. The mission should be refined and simplified so that everything is clear and understood. There should be an overall purpose, a desired result, or end state - the focus should be made clear to avoid mission creep. Once a detailed plan is developed, prioritize information and present everything in a simple, clear and concise format, so that there is no information overload. Discussion, questions and clarification should be encouraged - everyone needs to understand. Frontline troops above all should understand the strategic mission and the Commander's Intent - the directives need to be clear for the team, such as specific tasks and roles or how to respond to challenges and risks, and this should be briefed to all participants.

The planning process should be delegated down the chain of command as much as possible, where team leaders have ownership of their tasks, and everyone should particiapte in the planning process (this gives buy-in, encourages belief and understanding of the why). Senior leaders supervise the planning process, but should not get caught in the details. They should maintain an overarching perspective, so that they are able to "stand back and be the tactical genius", identifying weaknesses and gaps that others may not see. Different courses of action should be explored on how to best accomplish the mission, and crucial information gathered from the best sources, calling on experts where needed.

Plan for and mitigate risks where possible, ensuring the highest change of success through detailed plans to manage risk. Some risk cannot be mitigated, and some level of risk must be accepted - focus on those that can be controlled.

Constantly reflect on tactics and adapt. At the end of a mission, make time to reflect back on the lessons learned and how they can be implemented in the future to improve operations. Ask questions such as what went right, what went wrong, and what can be adapted to be more effective and increase advantages.

##### Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command

In general, you want to take responsibility for leading everyone, both up and down the chain of command. If things aren't going as expected, then determine what you can do better. One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your their own boss - tell their leader what they are going to do, instead of asking.

Leaders are focused on the planning and execution of tasks, projects, and operations to move team towards strategic goal. They have insight into bigger picture. Junior members should be focused on their specific jobs and in accomplishing their tactical mission. It is critical that each have an understand of the other's role, and that they comunicate with each other and how they fit into the bigger picture.

Leaders must regularly communicate the why to their team, as this is not always immediately obvious, leading down the chain of command. If frontline troops are not operating as expected, then it is the responsibility of the leader to understand why and try to work with their team to get the results needed. This requires empathy and humility to understand both sides.

Frontline members need to convey critical information to leadership and get them to understand what is happening on the front lines, pushing situational awareness up. This is leading up the chain of commmand. If leadership does not provide necessary support, understand why and try to work with them to get what you need, using influence, experience, knowledge, and communication, maintaining professionalism along the way since you can not rely on authority to be heard.

##### Decisiveness and Uncertainty

Often, answers to problems are never immediately obvious, and there are no 100% correct answers. The picture will never be complete, and success if never guaranteed.

It is critical for leaders to act decisively amid uncertainty, to make the best possible decisions based on the immediate information available, and not be paralyzed with fear. Difficult decisions need to be made promptly and adapted based on the evolving situation and new information. Waiting for a complete picture will result in delay and inaction.

Intelligence gathering and research are important, but must be emplyoed with realistic expectactions and not impede swift decision making. It is important to make an educated guess based on previous experience and current knowledge. Be comfortable in the chaos and act decisively amid uncertainty and having an incomplete picture.

##### Discipline Equals Freedom – The Dichotomy of Leadership

Leadership is about finding balance between opposing forces, which is often a difficult task. However, reconigition of this is a powerful tool. When a leader fails, it is usually the case that it is because they went too far in one direction. Some examples of such dichotomies include:

1. Balancing between discipine and freedom.

2. Lead but ready to follow and not let ego get in the way.

3. Aggressive but not overbearing.

4. Calm but not robotic.

5. Confident but not cocky.

6. Brave but not reckless.

7. Attentive to detail but not obsessive.

8. Hunble but not passive.

9. Extreme ownership but decentralized command.
