*Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win* by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin was a book that I had been meaning to read for a long time, ever since I first discovered Jocko Willink through [his appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnKcquMobHQ). Although I was initially uninterested on the topics of war and military, the conversation on leadership and extreme ownership really resonated with me, and has since had a big influence on my life with regard to leadership.

### Summary

When it comes to achieving a mission of any kind, leadership is the single most important factor for success. The following are principles for achieving optimal leadership.

#### Winning the War Within

##### Extreme Ownership

Leaders must own everything in their world, even if it is not in their direct control. They must accept responsibility for everything. They must admit mistakes and accept failures when they occur, without making excuses or blaming others.

##### No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders

> It's not what you preach, it's what you tolerate.

The performance of a team is the responsibility of the leader - this is closely related to extreme ownership. Leaders are responsible for enforcing standards, and getting the team to work together, where everyone is utilizing their strengths to cover each other's weaknesses. Leaders should always strive for constant improvement. Ideally, once a culture of extreme ownership is cultivated, teams would be able continue to improve even if the leader is removed.

##### Believe

A leader must truly believe in the missionthat they are accomplishing, and understand the bigger picture of why something is being done. This requires detaching from the immediate tactical mission, and understanding how it fits into the larger strategic picture. Goals must always be in alignment. It is the leader's responsibility to understand the "why" and convey this to their team. If they themselves do not understand the "why", then it is their responsibility to seek clarity from senior leadership.

##### Check the Ego

Most problems in teams come from ego. Ego clouds and disrupts everything, from the planning process, to the ability to listen and accept constructive criticism. Often, the most difficult ego to deal with is your own. In some cases, having some ego is good, such as when it drives people to achieve. But when ego clouds our judgement, prevents us from seeing the world as it is or honestly assessing ourselves and others, it is bad. Personal agendas should never influence actions. Exercise extreme ownership and be humble - confident but not cocky - while never being complacent.

#### The Laws of Combat

##### Cover and Move

This principle highlights teamwork and clear communication. All elements in an operation must work together and mutually support each other. Any kind of silos or division should be broken down, and everyone should work together, avoiding competition with each other, developing animosity, or blaming each other when problems occur. Leaders need to maintain perspective and remind the team of the "why" of what they are doing. Main and supporting efforts should be clearly identified, and the focus should be on how best to accomplish the strategic mission.

##### Simple

The more complex the plans are, the less people will understand, and the more issues will be compounded when they occur. Simplify and communicate plans as much as possible so that the lowest denominator can understand, in order to ensure success. Everyone needs to understand their part and how to react when things go wrong. Everyone, including junior members, should be encouraged to ask questions if they don't understand anything.

##### Prioritize and Execute

> Relax, look around, make a call.

When issues occur, it is important to remain calm, avoid getting caught in the details, maintain the strategic picture, and prioritize, making the best decision possible while leading. Trying to multitask will overwhelm everyone and cause the team to fail. Plan for problems in advanced in order to stay at least a step or two ahead of real-time problems. This ensures that everyone is prepared and knows how to prioritize and execute when needed. This also frees up bandwidth, allowing for greater decisiveness. Priorities can rapidly change - avoid getting fixated on a single target and recognize when priorities change, communicating with the team as soon as possible.

##### Decentralized Command

#### Sustaining Victory

##### Plan

##### Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command

##### Decisiveness and Uncertainty

##### Discipline Equals Freedom â€“ The Dichotomy of Leadership
