### Summary

#### Unexpected Entrenpreneurs

##### Renaissance

> Passion or skill + usefulness = success

Everyone has the skills they need to become an entrenpreneur - they just have to know where to look. Many projects start with related skills - i.e. you do not need the skills directly used in the project. Strive for coonvergence - the intersection between your passion and what others care about. To start a businesss, you need three things: a product or service, a group of people willing to pay for it, and a way to get paid. You do not need a lot of money to start.

##### Give Them the Fish

Instead of trying to teach people how to fish, give them the fish instead. Provide value by helping people and providing something desirable and of worth, created through exchange or effort. Give people what they really want, and not just what you think they should have.

Market core benefits that relate more to emotional needs than physical ones, instead of a list of features. People want more of some things such as time and less of other things such as stress. Focus on what can be added or taken away to improve someone's life.


##### Follow Your Passion... Maybe

Not every passion or hobby is worth building into a business, and not everyone will want to have a business that is based on a passion or hobby. Good businesses provide solutions to problems. Businesses that appear to be based on a passion are typically built on something indirectly related, not the passion itself.

Always ask yourself, "what is the business model"? A good example of this is establishing a specialized consulting business. This is something that can be done quickly and without significant overhead - the more specific, the better.

##### The New Demographics

Understand who your people are in terms of their shared beliefs and values. Use surveys to understand your customers and prospects - the more specific, the better. Determine what is the most important thing that you can do.

Establish yourself as an authority for these people. Try and simplify something about a process for others that they would like to benefit from. Take advantage of trends. Use the decision-making matrix: impact, effort, profitability, and vision.

#### Taking It to the Streets

##### The One-Page Business Plan

Have a bias towards action and launch your business as soon as possible - don't get caught up in planning. Instead, plan as you go and respond to the changing needs of your customers. Market your product before creating it in order to gauge interest and the initial response. Get your first sale as soon as possible. This creates motiviation that will drive you even further.

Keep your business plan simple, and try to offer a solution that addresses some kind of deep pain or desire:

* We provide... for...

* We help... do/achieve/other verb...

##### An Offer You Can't Refuse

What people want and what they say they want are not always the same thing - your job is to figure out the difference. Connect your offer to the direct benefits that customers will receive. Generally, people like to feel like they are choosing to buy something, instead of being sold something.

Think carefully about the objections that customers may have and respond to them in advanced. Instill urgency to get customers to make a decision and act now - this can be the difference between a good offer and a great offer. Offer reassurance and acknowledgement immeidately after someone buys into something. Find small and meaningful ways to go above and beyond expectations.

##### Launch!

Build anticipation for a launch by marketing far in advanced before the debut, and regularly communicating with prospects. Tell a good story and ensure you communicate why people should care now, and what the timelines are. Blend strategy - the why, the offer, and long-term plan - and tactics - the how, such as the timing, price, and what the pitch is.

##### Hustling: The Gentle Art of Self-Promotion

It is not a given that people will come just because you built something. Marketing is important in order to let people know what you built. Spend half of your time creating and the other half on connecting people on a regular schedule, getting the word out through the people you already know. In the beginning, say "yes" to every reasonable request, and more come more selective as you become more established.

##### Show Me the Money

The primary goal of operating a business is to make money - this is not to be confused with a hobby. Aim to get paid in more than one way and at more than one time through a variety of methods. You have access to more resources that you think - get creative in order to take advantage of different opportunities. You do not need to borrow money or go into debt to start a business.

#### Leverage and Next Steps

##### Moving on Up

Increasing income to an existing business is usually easier than initially starting the business. Horizontal expansion involves going broader by serving more customers with different but related interests. Vertical expansion involves going deeper by serving the same customers but with different levels of need.

Through careful choices, you can grow a business without dramatically increasing the workload, which will allow you to scale without hiring more people. For example, through increasing traffic, conversion rates, and price. Easy growth options include:

* Adding a service to a product-based business (or vice versa)

* Deploying a creative series of upsells and cross-sells

##### How to Franchise Yourself

You can multiply your output by leveraging a variety of skills and contacts, such as outsourcing, affiliate recruitment, and partnerships. Depending on the kind of business you are building and your personality, you may want to explore outsourcing. If you decide to enter into a partnership, ensure you have agreements in place and that these partnerships create leverage. Use the hub and spoke model of maintaining one online home base while using other outposts to diversity yourself through social media.

##### Going Long

There are many paths to achieving freedom through different working arragements with your business. You can pursue growth, decide to stay small, or do a combination of both. This all depends on what kind of freedom you would like to achieve.

Aim for a scalable business that is teachable and valuable, building teams and reducing owner dependency. Work on your business by focusing on tasks related to improvement, instead of just putting out fires. Regularly monitor 1 - 2 key metrics that are the lifeblood of your business, and check this on a monthly basis.

##### But What if I Fail?

The biggest battle is usually with our own fears. However, we are in control of this. Don't wait for permission or advice to start - just do it and take a big leap. Celebrate your successs and reflect on these when times are hard. Don't waste your time living someone else's life.
