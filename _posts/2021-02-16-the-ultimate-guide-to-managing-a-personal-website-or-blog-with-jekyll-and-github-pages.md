I first discovered Jekyll and GitHub pages in my second last year of university. During that time, I was looking to learn how to code in order to pursue a career in software development. I had read that Jekyll and GitHub pages were a good platform to start your personal website or blog on. However, being new to this, I was intimidated and confused by all of the resources that I came across for Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

Several years later, now that I do work in the software industry and have even created [a few Jekyll themes](https://github.com/LeNPaul) that are used by many, I realize that the confusion that I had in the beginning was unnecessary. Using Jekyll and GitHub Pages as a platform for starting your personal website or blog is actually very simple.

This series will walk you through everything you need to know in order to become a master at Jekyll and GitHub Pages, from getting started with your blogging or personal website to, creating your own Jekyll themes.

#### What is Jekyll?

[The official Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/) states that Jekyll is "a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites". This is actually a good summary of what Jekyll is, but for a beginner can be confusing. Let's break down what each part means.

##### Simple

Contrary to the initial introduction that I had with Jekyll, it is very simple to use. Posts are stored in text files that are formatted using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Once set up, adding new pages or posts is a matter of adding markdown text files to a directory. Jekyll handles the rest with building your site. There are no bloated user interfaces to work with, and your content is portable and completely controlled by you.

##### Blog-Aware

Jekyll was developed with blogging as the main use case. Typical features of blogs such as pages, posts, categories, and custom layouts are supported. There is also a massive community of Jekyll users for support and plenty of free Jekyll themes to choose from.

##### Static Site Generator

A static site is a site that consists of only text files. There are no databases or servers that are required for the site to operate. Jekyll will take your text files which contain your blog posts, and generate a static site that is served as your blog or personal website.

##### For Personal, Project, or Organization Sites

Jekyll is suitable for sites that don't require databases. This turns out to be perfect for managing personal websites and blogs, as static sites are simple to set up and maintain.

#### What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, which means GitHub offers the ability to host Jekyll sites. You can put your Jekyll site in a GitHub repository, and GitHub will serve your Jekyll site as a public website. This is offerred for free, and is a great way to get started with blogging or your personal website completely free.

Using GitHub Pages to host your Jekyll site is great for starting out, especially if you are not immediately expecting high volumes of traffic to your site. Combined with your own custom domain name, you can get started with your online presence for a very affordable cost.

#### Why You Should Start a Blog or Personal Website

Having an online presence is important, whether or not you are a full-time blogger or software developer. A blog or personal website under your own domain name is something that you completely own, and is not subject to the whims of any social media platform. It can be a place to showcase your work, or it can be a place where people can find more information about who you are and what you offer. It allows you to build your personal brand, which nowadays is more important than ever with rise of the internet.

#### Why You Should Use Jekyll

Jekyll is an open-sourced platform that allows you to completely control the look of your site and how you publish your content. Serving static websites offers performance and security benefits. Since you can use GitHub to host your sites, everything will be backed up and versioned, allowing you to easily roll back to previous versions of your site. Since your posts are markdown text files, your content is portable and is easily managed without having to deal with bloated user interfaces.
