*The Richest Man in Babylon* by George S. Clason is a classic book on personal finance. I first read this book while in the middle of university, and since graduating, the advice given in this book has proven to be valuable. This book presents timeless personal financial advice in the form of finctional parables that take place in ancient Babylon. It's a very short read, and much of the advice is condensed in the summary below.

### Summary

In ancient Babylon, a man by the name of Arkad, who was known as the richest man in Babylon, teaches his audiences how he became so rich through various parables. They can organized into roughly three groups, the "Seven Cures For a Lean Purse", "The Five Laws of Gold", and the last group being a few parables in the last few chapters of the book.

#### Seven Cures For a Lean Purse

1. Start thy purse to fattening

2. Control thy expenditures

3. Make thy gold multiply

4. Guard thy treasures from loss

5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment

6. Insure a future income

7. Increase thy ability to earn

#### The Five Laws of Gold

1. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earngs to create an estate for his future and that of his family.

2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.

3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.

4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.

5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

#### Lessons from the Parables

1. Better a little caution than a great regret.

2. We cannot afford to be without adequate protection.

3. Where the determination is, a way can be found.
