*Work Smarter with Speed Reading: A Teach Yourself Guide* by Tina Konstant was a book I came across many years ago at the library. This was when I first came across the idea of speed reading, during which I borrowed dozens of books on speed reading.

Generally, many speed reading books offer the same advice. I found this book to be the most complete, and every other speed reading resource I've come across since offers the same advice. Since reading this book a long time ago, I've found myself applying many of the tips I've learned. A summary of the book can be found below.
