*Work Smarter with Speed Reading: A Teach Yourself Guide* by Tina Konstant was a book I came across many years ago while browsing for books at the library. This was during the time that I first came across the idea of speed reading, during which I borrowed dozens of books on speed reading. 

Generally, many speed reading books offer the same advice. I found this book to be the most complete, and every other speed reading resource I've come across since offers the same advice. Since reading this book a long time ago, I've found myself applying some of the tips I've learned. A summary of the book can be found below.

### Summary

Speed reading is a skill that you develop. It's not something that you need to use all the time, as there are different techniques for different materials.

#### The Five-Step System

##### Prepare

How do you intend to use the new information that you learn? This helps you to focus while you are reading.

##### Structure

Read the front and back covers, the table of contens, the index, and scan the bibliography. Determine the structure of the book, such as the chapter headings, sub-headings, diagrams. Determine which parts of the book you don't need, and highlight the parts that you think you do need.

##### Language

Quickly scan each page and look for words that stand out - any technical language, jargon, or acronyms. Recognize any recurring themes and concepts, and ensure that you understand their meaning.

##### Content

Read the first paragraph of every section, and the first sentance of every paragraph (if the paragraph is long then read the last paragraph as well). Highlight, take notes, and mind-map what you read.

##### Selective Reading

Select intelligently what you need or want to read.

#### Speed Reading

1. Stop vocalizing words in your head as you read them

2. Use a pointer or guide when reading

3. Read the first sentance of a paragraph, skim the rest of the paragraph, and read the last sentance of the paragraph.
