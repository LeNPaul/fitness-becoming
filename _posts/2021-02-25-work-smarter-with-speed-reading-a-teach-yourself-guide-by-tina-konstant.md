*Work Smarter with Speed Reading: A Teach Yourself Guide* by Tina Konstant was a book I came across many years ago at the library. This was when I first came across the idea of speed reading, during which I borrowed dozens of books on speed reading.

Generally, many speed reading books offer the same advice. I found this book to be the most complete, and every other speed reading resource I've come across since offers the same advice. Since reading this book a long time ago, I've found myself applying many of the tips I've learned. A summary of the book can be found below.

### Summary

Speed reading is a skill that you develop and requires practice. Not only does it include techniques for improving your rate of reading, but it includes strategies for approaching different types of text, which change depending on the material and whether or not speed reading is appropriate for that context. It's not something that you need to use all the time, as you should use different techniques for different types of material. There is a physical and a mental aspect of speed reading.

#### Techniques for Speed Reading

1. Stop vocalizing words in your mind as you read them.

2. Use a pointer to guide your eyes as you are reading.

3. Utilize your peripheral vision to read multiple words on a line or even multiple lines at the same time.

4. Read the first sentence of a paragraph, skim the rest of the paragraph to get a general impression of what the paragraph is about, and read the last sentence of the paragraph if it is long. This is good for material you are familiar with.

#### The Five-Step System

This process will allow you to highlight what you need to read and eliminate what you need to ignore. It's a way to quickly process a book and get a high-level understanding of what the book is about before investing more time reading certain sections of the book. Essentially, you are building a framework for the book and filling in that framework as you read the important parts.

##### 1. Prepare

How do you intend to use the new information that you learn from reading? Ensure that you have a clear purpose for what you are reading, which will help you focus while reading.

##### 2. Preview

Acquaint yourself with the structure of your book by reading the front and back covers, the table of contents, scanning the index, bibiography, chapter headings, subheadings, and any diagrams or graphs. Pay attention to which parts of the book you do not need, and highlight the parts you think will be important.

##### 3. Passive Reading

Quickly scan each page looking for words that stand out - any technical language, jargon, or acronyms - and ensure you are familiar with the meaning of the language. Recognize any recurring themes and concepts, and ensure that you understand their meaning.

##### 4. Active Reading

Read the first paragraph of each section, and the first sentence of every paragraph (if the paragraph is long, then read the last sentence as well). During this time, highlight any important parts and take any notes needed, creating a mind map if possible.

##### 5. Selective Reading

Once you have a good framework of the content of the book, selectively read only what you need to read.

#### Optimize Your Reading

##### Vocabulary

Improving your vocabulary will allow you to read faster and improve comprehension.

##### Concentration

Increased concentration increases reading speed. Take frequent breaks when reading to ensure peak concentration. Increase interest, motiviation, reduce stress, reward yourself, organize your space and reduce clutter, stay healthy, meditate and do breathing exercises, and take frequent breaks.

##### Memory

No matter how fast you read, it is important to remember what you read and to apply that knowledge. Ensure that you have a purpose when you read and a plan to use the new information. Focus on developing interest in what you are reading. Pay attention to what you are reading. In addition to traditional note taking strategies - taking notes after you read - and memory techniques, try organizing what you learn into a mind map in order to build associations. Highlight key words and concepts while reading. Regularly revise your notes and what you learned.

##### Eye Strain

Strained eyes reduces reading speed - reduce eye strain to increase reading speed. Have good lighting, and ensure you have a comfortable desk and chair. Take care of your eyes for reading in order to reduce strain.

##### Distractions

Reading while distracted decreases your reading speed. Reduce distractions such as stress, hunger, tiredness, and external noise to increase reading speed. Ensure you are comfortable, are not straining your eyes, and there is nothing distracting you.

#### Strategies for Reading

Different materials require different strategies for reading.

##### Skimming and Scanning

Scanning is looking for specific information. Skimming is getting the general idea of what the text is about - who, what, where, why, when, and how. The goal is to get the message that the author is trying to convey, which does not depend on individual words.
