I first came across speed reading many years ago while browsing for books at the library. *Work Smarter with Speed Reading: A Teach Yourself Guide* by Tina Konstant was one of the books that I came across that had the most comprehensive information on speed reading. Every speed reading resource that I have come across since then offers the same advice found in this book, which I find myself applying on a regular basis. A summary of the book can be found below.

### Summary



#### Techniques for Speed Reading

1. Do not vocalize words in your mind as you read them.

2. Use a pointer to guide your eyes as you are reading.

3. Utilize your peripheral vision to read multiple words on a line or even multiple lines at the same time.

4. Read the first sentence of a paragraph, skim the rest of the paragraph to get a general impression of what the paragraph is about, and read the last sentence of the paragraph if it is long. This is good for material you are familiar with.

#### The Five-Step System



##### 1. Prepare

What is the purpose for what you are reading? What do you need to know, and how do you intend to use the new information? What do you already know about the subject that you are reading about?

##### 2. Preview

Acquaint yourself with the structure of what you are reading by reading the book covers, table of contents, chapter headings, subheadings, any summaries or conclusions, as well as scanning the index, bibliography, and any diagrams or graphs. Highlight the parts that you think will be important, and make note of the parts you do not need.
