*Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?* by Seth Godin was a book that had a tangible influence on my life in the past few years. Although there is a lot of repetition in this book, and this book could have been condensed into a single blog post, I would still recommend this book to others. This book is essentially a collection of related blog posts that are fun to read on their own, and there are some interesting tidbits of information scattered throughout.

However, you will get the majority of the value of the book through the main ideas found in the summary below.

### Summary

We all grew up being taught to follow the system. We were taught to follow instructions and obey the rules. This is no longer relevant or a good strategy for success.

What we need to do is choose to become a linchpin: someone who is indispensable, remarkable, able to exert emotional labour and build human connections. These linchpins are artists producing art. They generously give gifts to the world without expecting anything in return. In the process they are constantly fighting against their resistance, but when they succeed there is plenty of reward.

#### The System

This system evolved from the days when we needed factory workers - those who were good at following instructions and obeying the rules. We were taught that if we followed the system, we would be taken care of and succeed.

This is no longer a viable option. Acting as a cog in the machine makes you dispenable and leads to stress and anxiety. Organizations that are built around this factory model can not thrive, as automation and competition will inevitably lead to a race to produce even more products that are cheaper. There are diminishing returns in this system as fewer factors distinguish individuals and organizations from each other.

#### The Linchpin

In essence, they know how to solve interesting problems and how to lead. They do the job not being done. They take personal responsibility. They stand out. The three main ideas are that they produce art, build connections, and freely give gifts to the world.

##### Art

Art is defined as the ability to change peope with your work. This involves producing creative and innovative work, which requires emotional labour.

With the internet, normal people can now own the means of production and are no longer limited to being cogs in the machine. Art means that differences between average and remarkable are now larger.

There are no maps or instructions for how to produce art - part of the value of being a linchpin is the ability to navigate the unknown and create the maps or instructions, breaking any previous rules along the way.

#### Connections

The more connections are you able to make with and between people, the more successful you will be as a linchpin. People value connections and relationships more than anything else, and this is a distinguishing factor between individuals and organizations. Linchpins are leaders that know how to lead, and bring passion to what they do. having people skills amkes you indispensable. Don't follow scripts.

##### Gifts

The system is built on a foundation of transactions being done - money is exchanged for a quantity of work or a product. There is nothing that distinguishes any individual or organization from each other, other than the amount of money being exchanged.

Linchpins instead freely give their work to the world. These are true gifts, as there is no expectation of getting anything in return. This adds more value to the world, drives up demand, and differentiates linchpins and organizations from others. There is always room to add more value. The internet has made this even easier. Gifts build connections and brings the tribe together.

The more gifts you give, the more you will get in return.

#### The Resistance

Becoming a linchpin is a choice, not something that you are born with or is taught in school. However, along the journey of becoming and being a linchpin, you will come across the resistance, a voice inside of you that tells you you can't do it. This comes from your lizard brain. It will constantly make up excuses for not doing anything. Linchpins recognize this, and ship no matter what. This makes them valuable.

Understand that everyone has aspects that make them a genius. To work past the resistance, you need to ship and put your art out into the world. Don't chase perfectionism. Let go of the outcome and don't get attached to it. Do this no matter what, and you will eventually find success.

Real artists ship, no matter what.
