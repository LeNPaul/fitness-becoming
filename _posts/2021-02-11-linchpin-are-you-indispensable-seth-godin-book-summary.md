*Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?* by Seth Godin is a book that has had an influence on my life in the past few years. Although there is a lot of repetition in this book, and this book could have been condensed into a single blog post, I would still recommend this book. It is essentially a collection of related blog posts that are fun to read on their own, and there are some interesting tidbits of information scattered throughout.

That being said, you will get most of the value of the book through the main ideas found in the summary below.

### Summary

We all grew up being taught to follow the system, where we follow instructions and obey the rules. This is no longer relevant or a good strategy for success. What we need to do is choose to become a linchpin: someone who is indispensable, remarkable, able to exert emotional labour into their work and build human connections.

#### The System

This system evolved from the days when we needed factory workers - those who were good at following instructions and obeying the rules. We were taught that if we followed the system, we would be taken care of and be successful. This is no longer a viable option.

Acting as a cog in the machine makes you dispensable. In addition, organizations that are built around this factory model can no longer thrive, as automation and competition will inevitably lead to a race to produce cheaper products at a larger scale. There are diminishing returns in this system as fewer factors distinguish individuals and organizations from each other.

#### The Linchpin

Linchpins know how to solve interesting problems and lead. They take personal responsibility and do the job not being done. They produce art, build connections, and freely give gifts to the world. In the process, they stand out from the average.

##### Art

Art is defined as the ability to change people with your work. This involves producing creative and innovative work, which requires putting emotional labour into your work.

The challenge is that there are no maps or instructions for how to produce art. Part of the value of being a linchpin is that they are able to navigate the unknown and create the maps or instructions, breaking previous rules if necessary.

With the internet, normal people can now own the means of production and are no longer limited to being cogs in the machine or limited in the art they produce.

##### Connections

Linchpins are able to build connections with and between people. People value connections and relationships more than anything else, and this is a factor that distinguishes between average and remarkable individuals as well as organizations.

Part of building connections includes bringing passion into what they do and acting as leaders. Genuine connections can not be made through a script.

##### Gifts

The system is a zero-sum game built on transactions: money is exchanged for a quantity of work or a product. There is nothing that distinguishes individuals or organizations from each other, other than the amount of money being exchanged.

Linchpins, on the other hand, freely give their work to the world. These are true gifts, as there is no expectation of getting anything in return. In this way, they add more value to the world, differentiate themselves from others, and drive up demand for their work.

In addition to this, gifts brings groups of people together. There is always room to add more value. The internet has made this even easier. The more gifts you give, the more you will get in return.

#### The Resistance

Becoming a linchpin is a choice, not something that you are born with or is taught in school. However, along the journey of becoming and being a linchpin, you will come across the resistance. This is a voice inside of you that tells you that you are not capable or tries to distract you from your work.

This comes from your lizard brain, the instinctual part of your brain that avoids failure and likes to stay in its comfort zone. It will constantly make up excuses for not being able to do something. Linchpins recognize this, and ship no matter what, which is part of what makes them valuable.

Understand that everyone has aspects that make them a genius. To work past the resistance, you need to ship and put your art out into the world. Don't chase perfectionism. Let go of the outcome and don't get attached to it. Do this no matter what, and you will eventually find success.
