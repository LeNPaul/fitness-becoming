*The Pomodoro Technique: The Life-Changing Time-Management System* by Francesco Cirillo was a life-changing book for me. I discovered the Pomodoro technique almost a decade ago while studying in university, and since then, I have been consistently using this technique when doing any kind of focused work.

Not many people know that the creator of the Pomodoro Technique also wrote a small book outlining their technique and philosophy. Although the Pomodoro technique is very simple and can be explained in one sentence, this book offers a more complete framework for becoming more efficient at your work and handling distractions.

It's a very short read that I would recommend if you are interested, however the following summary also captures the main ideas of the book as well.

### Summary

The Pomodoro technique can be summarized by the following points:

1. A Pomodoro consists of 25 minutes of focused work plus a 5 minute break.

2. Every four Pomodoros, take a longer 15 - 30 minute break.

3. The Pomodoro is indivisible and represents the smallest unit of focused work.

4. If a Pomodoro begins, it must be completed. If it is interrupted, then it is considered void and not counted. If the work is completed before the end of a Pomodoro, then the extra time should be spent reviewing until the end.

5. Pomodoros should be protected - any interruptions should be anticipated and redirected before starting a Pomodoro.

6. If an activity requires more than 5 -7 Pomodoros, then break it down into smaller tasks.

There are five objectives with the Pomodoro technique that the author goes into more detail on that outline the philosophy of the Pomodoro technique.

#### Objective I: Find Out How Much Effort an Activity Requires

An "Activity Inventory Sheet" contains a list of activities that must be completed. At the beginning of each day, prioritize and choose tasks from the Activity Inventory Sheet that will be added to the "To Do Today" list. Choose a task from the "To Do Today" list and complete Pomodoros until the task is completed, after which the task will be crossed off of the "To Do Today" list. Mark how many Pomodoros were done in order to complete a task. This can be used to estimate how many Pomodoros it took to complete a certain task.

#### Objective II: Cut Down on Interruptions

If interruptions occur during a Pomodoro, such as a new incoming task, write down that task in an "Unplanned & Urgent" list and continue focusing on the current Pomodoro. If an unrelated thought comes into your mind, write it down, and mark that there was an interruption next to your current Pomodoro. Afterwards, review your lists and determine if it needs to be done now or if it can wait for later.

True emergency interruptions are rare - for example, phone calls can go to voice mail, or you can ask colleagues to not interruption during certain time. People will eventually trust you when you promise to follow-back and value your time.

#### Objective III: Estimate the Effort for Activities

For each task, estimate how many Pomodoros it will take to complete that task. If it takes more than 5 - 7 Pomodoros, then break the task down into smaller tasks. If it takes less than one Pomodoro, then combine common tasks together into one Pomodoro. Each day, choose tasks so that the total number of Pomodoros does not excede the amount you can do in a day. Usually this is eight Pomodoros a day. If you go over your estimate, then mark the extra Pomodoros to indicate this.

#### Objective IV: Make the Pomodoro More Effective

Within each Pomodoro,  you can use the first few minutes to review what was done in the previous related Pomodoros, and the last few minutes to review what was done in the current Pomodoro. You can also structure sets of Pomodoros in a similar way.

#### Objective V: Set up a Timetable

Set limits on how much time you spend working. This motivates discipline during your time period to ensure you complete the work you need to do. This also allows you to separate between work and free time, in order to avoid burnout. This will also allow you to measure your results for the day, whether you achieved what you had planned at the beginning. This will also allow you to predict how many Pomodoros you can reliably complete in a day.
