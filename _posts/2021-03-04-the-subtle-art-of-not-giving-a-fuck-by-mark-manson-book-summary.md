### Summary

#### Don't Try

> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of oneâ€™s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

The more you try to do something, the less likely you are to succeed. Conversely, the less you try to succeed at something, the more likely you are to succeed. Everything worthwhile in life is won through overcoming the associated negative experience. That being said, there are some subtleties with this rule:

1. Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.

2. To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.

3. Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.

#### Happiness is a Problem

> This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.

Suffering is an inherent part of life. Happiness comes from solving problems. This does not mean that you get rid of problems or that they go away, but rather you move on to new problems. Don't deny your problems or have a victim mentality. Instead, choose the struggle and problems you are willing to stick through - the joy is in the climb itself.

#### You Are Not Special

Our problems are not unique, and most people are average at most things they do. Avoid being entitled and thinking that everything revolves around you. Entitlement causes you to try and chase the extremes, whether it being a victim or being exceptional. Accepting that you are average is not failure - the true measure of self-worth is how you feel about your negative experiences, not your positive ones (i.e. how comfortable you are with your weaknesses).

#### The Value of Suffering

Our suffering comes as a result of what our values are, and whether or not they are satisfied. To truly understand our values, we need self-awareness. Self-awareness is like an onion, and there are three levels:

1. Simple understanding of one's emotions.

2. Asking why we feel certain emotions.

3. Our personal values, and why we choose them.

#### You Are Always Choosing

#### You're Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)

#### Failure is the Way Forward

#### The Importance of Saying No

#### ... And Then You Die
