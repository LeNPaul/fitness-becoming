### Summary

#### Don't Try

> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of oneâ€™s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

The more you try to do something, the less likely you are to succeed. Conversely, the less you try to succeed at something, the more likely you are to succeed. Everything worthwhile in life is won through overcoming the associated negative experience. That being said, there are some subtleties with this rule:

1. Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.

2. To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.

3. Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.

#### Happiness is a Problem

> This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. Our problems birth our happiness, along with slightly better, slightly upgraded problems.

Suffering is an inherent part of life. Happiness comes from solving problems. This does not mean that you get rid of problems or that they go away, but rather you move on to new problems. Don't deny your problems or have a victim mentality. Instead, choose the struggle and problems you are willing to stick through - the joy is in the climb itself.

#### You Are Not Special

Our problems are not unique, and most people are average at most things they do. Avoid being entitled and thinking that everything revolves around you. Entitlement causes you to try and chase the extremes, whether it being a victim or being exceptional. Accepting that you are average is not failure - the true measure of self-worth is how you feel about your negative experiences, not your positive ones (i.e. how comfortable you are with your weaknesses).

#### The Value of Suffering

Our suffering comes as a result of what our standards or values are, and whether or not they are satisfied. To truly understand our values, we need self-awareness. Self-awareness is like an onion, and there are three levels:

1. Simple understanding of one's emotions.

2. Asking why we feel certain emotions.

3. Our personal values, and why we choose them.

Examples of bad values are chasing pleasure, material success, and always being right. If we have bad values, then we will always suffer. Good values are reality based, socially constructive, within  your control, and are based on internal factors.

However, always staying positive is also a bad value, because it denies us problems and prevents us from facing them and solving them. Some of the greatest achievements in life require some kind of suffering to achieve them. Self-improvement is really about choosing better values to struggle for.

#### You Are Always Choosing

We feel the most empowered when we are choosing our problems. We are always choosing our problems, even if we don't think we are. The best approach is to choose to take full responsibility for everything in your life, including your problems. This will give us power in our lives. If we choose not to, then we are choosing to be the victim, and passing off our responsibility to others.

#### You're Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)

Our brains are not perfect, and chances are, all of our beliefs are wrong - only some are less wrong than others. Growth is therefore an iterative process, gradually going from wrong to slightly better. Certainty is the enemy of growth, because people become entitled and do not want to challenge what they think or change. Situations where you are wrong or doubtful bring opportunity for growth.

> The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it

Your idea of who you are is arbitrary, and holding onto this identity stifles growth. You are not special - let go of your identity in order to be free. Make your identity broad and not narrow. The following questions will help you to be less certain of yourself:

1. What if I'm wrong?

2. What would it mean if I were wrong?

3. Would being wrong create a better or a worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?

#### Failure is the Way Forward

Growing and improving is based on thousands of tiny failures. When we try too hard to stay in our comfort zones and avoid failure (as many learn to do later in life), we stop growing. Social media has made it easier to see the extreme ends of the bell curve - to see the success but not the failure that it took to get there. Good values are process orientated and have many iterations.

> Our proudest achievements come in the face of the greatest adversity. Our pain often makes us stronger, more resilient, more grounded.

Denying pains means denying our potential. Be comfortable with feeling bad while in the process of learning and growing, and learn how to sustain this pain.

> Action isn't just the effect of motivation; it's also the cause of it.

Motivation is actually an endless loop that goes from action, to inspiration, to motiviation. You can start this loop by taking action and doing something. This is the "do something" principle.

> Don't just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow.

#### The Importance of Saying No

It is important to accept rejection, as well as giving the rejection. This establishes trust, as you have to be honest and say "no" when you mean it. Rejecting means that you have values and standards that you stand for, and you are able to stick to them. This gives you direction in life and provides meaning. Although avoiding rejecting gives us short term plesaure, in the long term it makes us directionless and without meaning. To truly appreciate something, you must commit to it, and in doing so, you must reject everything else.

Learn how to set boundaries and say "no" when needed - accepting responsibility for yourself and not others, and not expecting anyone else to take responsibility for your problems.


#### ... And Then You Die

> The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.

Death gives us meaning to our lives, and puts things into perspective, allowing us to focus on the important things. See yourself as something bigger than yourself, and choose values that go beyond serving yourself. Happiness comes from caring about something greater than yourself.
